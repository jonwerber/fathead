    <p class="header-p">Fathead is the gift that provides cheer and overwhelming excitement on birthdays or
        holidays. As
        it is unwrapped,
        your child will be
        amazed at the vibrant images of their favorite character, superstar athlete or an awe-inspiring animal. The
        detail captured in a Fathead
        will spark your child’s imagination and have them playing along with the Fathead once it is on their wall.
        As
        seen in the video, Fathead
        causes reactions that have not been witnessed since the Turbo-Man doll.</p>

    <p class="pad-top-med">Once you have the space picked out, the installation is a breeze. The majority of Fatheads go
        up as easy as
        peel-and-stick. However, there are also
        transfer decals (these will have “Rub On Transfer” stated on the product page) that have more intricate designs.
        Because of their more detailed designs,
        transfer wall decals are applied using the transfer method, (read more) instead of a peel-and-stick.</p>

    <h3 class="accent-color pad-top-sm">Did You Know?</h3>
    <p class="">In addition to the main wall decal, the majority of Fatheads also come with additional decals. For
        example, an
        athlete will come with a name plate and
        team logo wall decals and a character will come with other officially licensed artwork.</p>

    <h2 class="accent-color step-header">STEP 2:</h2>
    <h3 class="accent-color step-subheader">Choose Your Product Category</h3>
    <p class="">Fathead became a household name from the products of life-size athletes but has since extended to
        hundreds of
        different product categories. All of our
        licensed products are officially licensed, so you get the artwork created by Disney, Nickelodeon, Nintendo,
        etc., or the team’s official logos for sports
        products. You are sure to find a Fathead your child will love!</p>
